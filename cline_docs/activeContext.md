# Active Context

- What you're working on now: Finalizing the session scaffolding, integrating shared and session-specific docs, and preparing for secrets injection and session launch.
- Recent changes: Added/updated shared project and team docs, session agent instructions, .env.sample, and clarified container setup and secrets management per PM's expanded setup doc.
- Next steps: Review all scaffolding and docs, copy env.sample to each session as .env, fill in real secrets, and verify with PM before running new_session.sh for each session.
