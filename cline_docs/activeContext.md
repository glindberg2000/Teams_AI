# Active Context

## Current Work
- Verified and improved team-cli functionality:
  - Confirmed unique SSH key generation for each session in crew creation
  - Fixed API key propagation from team env to individual sessions
  - Improved environment variable handling
  - Added proper SLACK_TEAM_ID synchronization

## Recent Changes
- Added ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and PERPLEXITY_API_KEY to team env template
- Verified SSH key generation uniqueness across sessions
- Improved project-based organization for sessions
- Enhanced environment variable propagation

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing custom SSH key naming for better visibility
2. Add API key format validation
3. Consider implementing key rotation capabilities
4. Continue testing with different session configurations

## Current State
- All core functionality is working as expected
- Environment variable handling is robust
- SSH key generation is unique per session
- Project-based organization is implemented
