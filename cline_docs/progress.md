# Progress

## Completed
- Implemented project-based organization for sessions
- Fixed SLACK_TEAM_ID synchronization across sessions
- Added proper API key propagation (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and PERPLEXITY_API_KEY) from team env to individual sessions
- Verified unique SSH key generation for each session in crew creation
- Added proper environment variable handling and documentation

## In Progress
- Improving documentation and user feedback
- Testing additional session configurations

## To Do
- Consider adding custom SSH key naming scheme for better visibility
- Add validation for API key formats
- Consider adding key rotation capabilities

# Progress Status

- What works: All session folders and shared docs are scaffolded, agent instructions are in place, .env.sample is available, and container setup patterns are documented.
- What's left to build: Populate .env files with real secrets, verify session-specific configs, and finalize any tweaks per PM/lead feedback.
- Progress status: Ready for review and secrets injection; sessions can be launched once verified.
