# Progress
 
- What works: All session folders and shared docs are scaffolded, agent instructions are in place, .env.sample is available, and container setup patterns are documented.
- What's left to build: Populate .env files with real secrets, verify session-specific configs, and finalize any tweaks per PM/lead feedback.
- Progress status: Ready for review and secrets injection; sessions can be launched once verified.
