# LedgerFlow AI Team: End-to-End Workflow & Documentation Verification

**Date:** May 3, 2024

## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful end-to-end test of the team scaffolding and session generation workflow after the repository reorganization. It also summarizes the new documentation structure and onboarding process for both human and AI users.

## 1. End-to-End Workflow Verification

### Steps Performed
1. **Scaffold Team Creation**
   - Ran: `python tools/scaffold_team.py --project test-clean --prefix test --domain example.com`
   - Result: Created `teams/test-clean/config/env`, `env.template`, and `checklist.md`.
2. **Filled in Environment File**
   - Edited `teams/test-clean/config/env` with dummy data for all required keys.
3. **Team CLI Session Generation**
   - Ran: `python tools/team_cli.py create-crew --env-file teams/test-clean/config/env`
   - Result: Created sessions for `pm_guardian`, `python_coder`, and `reviewer` (fallback to python_coder template for reviewer).
   - Each session has:
     - `.env` file (with dummy data and template variables)
     - `mcp_config.json` (with dummy tokens)
     - Unique SSH keypair in `.ssh/`
     - Inherited documentation in `docs/global/` and `docs/role/`
     - Devcontainer config and restore script
4. **Verification of Generated Files**
   - All expected session folders and files were created.
   - No secrets or sensitive data are committed.
   - Documentation inheritance and SSH key generation are correct.

```

### Documentation Organization
- **README.md**: Main entrypoint for onboarding and workflow.
- **cline_docs/**: Project-level docs, migration guides, advanced usage, and reports.
- **docs/**: Generated/inherited agent docs for containers/sessions.
- **roles/**: Role templates and documentation.
- **teams/**: User-generated, gitignored (no secrets in repo).

## 3. Onboarding & Usage

### Official Workflow
1. Scaffold a new team with `scaffold_team.py`
2. Fill in the environment file with API keys and tokens
3. Generate agent sessions with `team_cli.py`
4. Launch and use sessions as needed

### Security
- No secrets or sensitive data are committed
- Each agent/session gets a unique SSH keypair
- Documentation inheritance is automatic and correct

---

## 4. Recommendations & Next Steps

- All legacy, deprecated, and backup files have been removed
- All documentation is up to date and discoverable
- The repository is ready for onboarding, further optimization, and rule improvements
- See README.md and cline_docs/ for further details
