# Team CLI & Infra Enhancements Proposal

**Date:** May 3, 2024

## Rationale

With the LedgerFlow AI Team framework now stable and secure, the next step is to enhance the CLI and infrastructure to support dynamic, ongoing team operations. These enhancements will empower a Team Manager (human or AI) to maintain, scale, and audit live teams with minimal friction, supporting real-world, evolving project needs.

---

## Proposed Features

### 1. Dynamic Team Member Management
- `add-member` and `remove-member` CLI commands to add or remove roles from a team, updating environment files, docs, and session structure automatically.
- Auto-generate stub docs and config for new roles, with prompts for missing info.

### 2. Role/Session Lifecycle Management
- Archive, disable, or reactivate sessions/roles (not just delete).
- Rotate secrets/keys for a session or the whole team with a single command.

### 3. Automated Documentation Sync
- CLI command to sync or update inherited docs across all sessions if global/project/role docs change.
- Option to diff docs between source and session for auditability.

### 4. Health & Status Dashboard
- CLI or web dashboard to show which sessions are running, which keys are missing/expired, and which docs are out of sync.
- Integration with Slack for status notifications.

### 5. Onboarding/Offboarding Automation
- Generate onboarding checklists and offboarding scripts for new/removed team members.
- Automated reminders for missing secrets or incomplete setup.

### 6. Security & Compliance
- CLI audit for secrets in the wrong place, permissions, or doc inheritance violations.
- Option to auto-fix or report issues.

### 7. Template/Role Marketplace
- Ability to pull new role templates from a central repo or marketplace.
- Share custom roles with other teams.

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize proposed enhancements.
2. Design CLI commands and workflows for highest-priority features.
3. Implement incrementally, ensuring backward compatibility and security.

**Context:**
- The current documentation and workflow structure is finalized and described in [README.md](../../README.md) and [cline_docs/reports/DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_PROPOSAL.md).
- These enhancements are for future development and are not yet implemented.
