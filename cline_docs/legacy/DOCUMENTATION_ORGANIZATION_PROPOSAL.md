# Documentation & Directory Organization Proposal (Fulfilled)

**Date:** May 3, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Fulfilled / Archived (as of latest repo review)

---

## Summary

This proposal recommended a clear separation between:
- **Project/framework documentation** (`cline_docs/`)
- **Generated/inherited agent documentation** (`docs/`)
- **Role templates and documentation** (`roles/`)
- **Migration, verification, and advanced usage docs** (`cline_docs/reports/`)

**As of the latest review, this structure is fully implemented and enforced in the repository.**

---

## Current State (Verified)

- All agent containers and sessions only inherit documentation from:
  - `docs/global/`
  - `docs/projects/{project}/`
  - `roles/{role}/docs/`
- **No code or template references `cline_docs/` for agent/session documentation.**
- `cline_docs/` is reserved for project-level, migration, and advanced usage docs, and is never copied into containers.
- The onboarding and documentation structure is clearly described in [README.md](../../README.md).

---

## Action

- No further reorganization is needed.
- This proposal is now archived as fulfilled.
- For onboarding, doc structure, and workflow, see [README.md](../../README.md).
- For advanced/project-level docs, see `cline_docs/`.
- For agent/session docs, see `docs/` and `roles/`.

---

## Note

> **No agent container or session will ever inherit or reference `cline_docs/`; only `docs/` and `roles/` are used for agent documentation.**
