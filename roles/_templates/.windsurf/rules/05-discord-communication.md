# Discord Communication Protocol

Follow these guidelines for communicating project updates, memory changes, and task status via Discord.

## Status Updates

- Post `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` at the start of each new task to indicate context awareness.
- Share condensed snippets from `activeContext.md` or `progress.md` when discussing current work.
- Use code blocks for sharing code snippets or configuration examples.
- Format important information with appropriate markdown (bold, italic, lists) for readability.

## Memory Bank Updates

- Announce significant Memory Bank updates to the appropriate role-specific channel.
- Include a brief summary of changes and why they were made.
- Provide direct quotes of key updates for immediate reference.
- Link to GitHub commits or PRs containing the full Memory Bank changes.

## Collaboration Requests

- Clearly state what input or review is needed from team members.
- Provide sufficient context so others can respond without extensive background research.
- Specify deadlines or time sensitivity for required responses.
- Follow up on open requests that haven't received a response.

## Task Handoffs

- Document the exact state of work in `activeContext.md` before handoff.
- Explicitly state what work remains to be done.
- Highlight any blockers or dependencies.
- Tag the specific team member(s) taking over the task.
