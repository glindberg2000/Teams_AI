# LedgerFlow AI Team Reorganization Complete

## Summary of Changes

The repository reorganization has been successfully completed. The codebase now follows a domain-centric approach with teams as the primary organizational units, which improves maintainability and separation of concerns.

### Key Changes

1. **New Directory Structure**
   - `teams/{project}/` - Contains config and sessions for each team
     - `teams/{project}/config/` - Configuration files (env, env.template, checklist.md)
     - `teams/{project}/sessions/` - Agent sessions for the project
   - `tools/` - Centralized command-line tools (scaffold_team.py, team_cli.py)
   - `roles/` - Role templates and documentation
   - `templates/` - System-wide templates

2. **Environment Files**
   - Old: `.env.{project}` in the root directory
   - New: `teams/{project}/config/env`

3. **Session Directories**
   - Old: `sessions/{project}/{agent}/`
   - New: `teams/{project}/sessions/{agent}/`

4. **Tool Paths**
   - Old: `scaffold_team.py`, `team-cli/team_cli.py`
   - New: `tools/scaffold_team.py`, `tools/team_cli.py`

## Implementation Process

The reorganization was implemented through a series of steps:

1. **Files Moved** - Created a new directory structure with tools, teams, roles, and templates
2. **Path References Updated** - All path references in the code were updated to use the new structure
3. **Shell Scripts Updated** - Path references in shell scripts were updated using regex replacements
4. **Directory Structure Standardized** - Ensured each team has a config and sessions directory
5. **Environment Variables Fixed** - Created additional script to ensure proper .env file generation

## Scripts Created

1. `organize_repo.py` - The main script to move files to the new structure (already run)
2. `update_scaffold_team.py` - Updated path references in scaffold_team.py
3. `update_shell_scripts.py` - Updated path references in shell scripts
4. `move_env_files.py` - Copied environment files to their new locations
5. `move_sessions.py` - Copied session directories to their new locations
6. `create_missing_directories.py` - Created missing config and sessions directories
7. `test_reorganization.py` - Tested that the reorganization was successful
8. `fix_env_files.py` - Fixes .env and MCP config files to properly resolve template variables

## Environment File Processing

The reorganization identified and fixed issues with environment file generation:

1. **Template Variable Resolution** - The `fix_env_files.py` script ensures template variables like `${TEAM_NAME}` are properly resolved
2. **Role-Specific Variables** - Only includes variables relevant to a specific agent/role
3. **MCP Configuration** - Cleans up token values in MCP configuration JSON files
4. **SSH Key Generation** - Verifies SSH keys are unique for each session

To fix environment files in existing sessions, run:
```bash
python fix_env_files.py [project_name]
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Test** - Verify that all functionality works with the new structure
2. **Remove Duplicates** - Once confident in the new structure, remove the old files and directories:
   - `.env.*` files in the root directory
   - `sessions/` directory
   - Original `scaffold_team.py` in the root directory
   - Original `team-cli/` directory
3. **Update Documentation** - Update any additional documentation to reference the new paths
4. **Commit Changes** - Commit all changes to git and merge the `reorg` branch

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Team

```bash
# Create a new team
python tools/scaffold_team.py --project myteam --prefix user --domain example.com

# Create sessions for the team
python tools/team_cli.py create-crew --env-file teams/myteam/config/env

# Fix environment files if needed
python fix_env_files.py myteam
```

### Managing Sessions

```bash
# Create a single session
python tools/team_cli.py create-session --name agent1 --role python_coder --project myteam

# Add a new role
python tools/team_cli.py add-role --name new_role
```

The reorganization is now complete and all functionality has been migrated to the new structure.
