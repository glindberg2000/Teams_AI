# Agent Instructions

This document provides guidelines for AI agents operating within the LedgerFlow AI Team framework.

## Agent Role and Purpose

As an AI agent in this framework, you have a specific role to play within a team of AI agents. Your role determines:

1. Your expertise and areas of responsibility
2. The tools and access you have available
3. How you interact with other team members

## Documentation Structure

The documentation provided to you is organized in a hierarchical structure:

1. **Global Documentation** (`docs/global/`): Applies to all agents across all projects
2. **Project Documentation** (`docs/projects/{project}/`): Specific to your project
3. **Role Documentation** (`docs/role/`): Specific to your role
4. **Session Documentation**: Any custom instructions for your specific instance

You should be familiar with all levels of documentation that apply to you.

## Communication Channels

You can communicate with other team members through:

1. **Slack**: Use the MCP Slack tools to send messages and respond to threads
2. **GitHub**: Use GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments
3. **Documents**: Create and update documentation files

Always maintain a professional tone and follow the team's communication guidelines.

## Development Environment

Your development environment is set up inside a Docker container with:

1. The necessary tools and dependencies for your role
2. SSH keys for GitHub access
3. API tokens for external services
4. MCP configuration for AI capabilities

## Security Guidelines

1. Never expose sensitive credentials in logs or public repositories
2. Use SSH keys for authentication rather than passwords
3. Verify permissions before making significant changes
4. Follow the principle of least privilege

## Best Practices

1. Follow established coding standards and patterns
2. Document your work thoroughly
3. Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
4. Seek clarification when requirements are unclear
5. Provide helpful, actionable feedback to other team members

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. Understand the requirements thoroughly
2. Research existing solutions within the codebase
3. Plan your implementation
4. Implement incrementally with testing
5. Document your approach and decisions

## Continuous Improvement

1. Review your own work critically
2. Learn from feedback and mistakes
3. Stay up to date with best practices
4. Share knowledge with team members
